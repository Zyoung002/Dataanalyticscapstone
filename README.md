WElcome to the Trends in Gaming project!!!

This project aims to show you a few trends regarding how people of varying ages play video games and what types of games are most popular!

We used a few sources from a Gaming survey conducted amongst both men and women of varying ages, as well as a game sales database going all the way back to 1978! 

### Virtual Environment Instructions
1. After you have cloned the repo to your machine, navigate to the project folder in GitBash/Terminal.
2. Create a virtual environment in the project folder.
3. Activate the virtual environment.
4. Install the required packages.
5. When you are done working on your repo, deactivate the virtual environment.

**Virtual environment commands**

| Command | Linux/Mac | Git Bash |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Create | python3 -m venv .venv | python -m venv .venv |
| Activate | source .venv/bin/activate | source .venv/Scripts/activate |
| Install | pip install -r requirements.txt| pip install -r requirements.txt|
| Deactivate | deactivate | deactivate |

Once activated you should be able to run the program in the Gaming_Trends.ipynb.

Note for VS Code Users:

If you're using VS Code to run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script, ensure that the virtual environment(venv) is selected as the kernel. This is necessary for the modules installed from requirements.txt to be active when running the project.

To select the kernel, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) and search for "Python: Select Interpreter". Choose the one for the virtual environment (venv).
